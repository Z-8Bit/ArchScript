## My personal ArchScript

1. Just connect to either WiFi using **`iwctl`** or Ethernet.
2. Partition your disks, my script doesn't include swap by default but it's commented out.
3. Clone the repository with **`git clone https://github.com/Z-8Bit/ArchScript`**.
4. Make the script an executable by doing **`cd TestArch && chmod +x arch.sh`**.
5. Run the script by doing **`./arch.sh`**
